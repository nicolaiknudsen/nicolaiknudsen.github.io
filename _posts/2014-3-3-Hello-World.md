# Introduction

I’m a philosopher working on issues in phenomenology, social ontology, ethics, and political philosophy. Most of my work focuses on the relation between human nature and sociality. I try to answer ontological questions like: What enables individual minded creatures to constitute a group, and what does this tell us about the fundamental nature of the human being? In ethics, I examine how our ties to specific communities shape our moral agency and which kind of responsibility can be ascribed to groups rather than mere collections of individuals.

I have additional interests in the philosophy of religion, existentialism, and the philosophy of time.

**My current research projects** are

- A book manuscript entitled *Heidegger’s Social Ontology*. 
- A series of articles on *the phenomenology of shared responsibility*. This project is funded by The Carlsberg Foundation. You can find a brief description of the project [here](https://www.carlsbergfondet.dk/da/Forskningsaktiviteter/Bevillingsstatistik/Bevillingsoversigt/CF19_0312_Nicolai-Krejberg-Knudsen).


# Recent news

The following papers are **recently published or forthcoming**:

- [“Heidegger and the genesis of social ontology”](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ejop.12517) in *European Journal of Philosophy.*
        This paper critically examines Heidegger’s early approach to social ontology. It discusses how he conceived of “the social world” and tried to distinguish it from other regions of existence, before he finally he arrived on the mature vision of social ontology to be found in *Being and Time* according to which sociality [*Mitsein*] is a (transcendental) dimension of the world as such rather than a domain within the world.  
- “Heideggers etik?” in *Slagmark* (Danish),
        This paper provides a critical discussion of two recent books on the relation between Heidegger’s ethics and ontology (Sonia Sikka’s *Heidegger, Morality and Politics* and James Reid’s *Heidegger’s Moral Ontology*) in light of (1) the publication of the Black Notebooks and (2) what I take to be an increasing interest in the practical dimension of phenomenology as such.

**In other news**, my family and I were supposed to live in Oxford by now in order for me to commence my Research Fellowship, but we had to cancel our travel plans due to the COVID-19 outbreak. We are currently stuck in a vacation house by the North Sea (in a landscape that [looks pretty much look this](https://www.google.com/search?q=vesterhavet&newwindow=1&sxsrf=ALeKk000v8Bknko2Tbqk3Ah0vQugbZndLA:1585829787322&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwir5Jap3MnoAhUy4KYKHSEyA5EQ_AUoAXoECA0QAw&cshid=1585829983804008&biw=1536&bih=711)). This isn’t too bad, all things considered.
